 * Module Description:
 *  This provides the hardware setup to route the AVS UART to a port on
 *  the reference board.  Note that this port may be used by other code
 *  so should not be enabled by default.  Instead, use the BBS equivalent
 *  script that does this.  This is here to demonstrate how it can be
 *  done and for developer convience.
